    - "Assemble spawn.table.v1 with:
         friendly_npcs: 0–2 per safehouse,
         hostile_dogs: 3–5 on perimeter,
         scavengers: 1–2 wandering near fences."
    - "Place perimeter hazards:
         dog-traps: 6 in corridor/choke points,
         oil-fires: 2 near a collapsed fence segment."
    - "Export level.json and level_nav.json; register both in world/registry.yml."
